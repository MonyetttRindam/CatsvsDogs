# Cats vs Dogs Classification using CNN 🐱🐶

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs.  
The model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.
